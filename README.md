After the success of your previous missions, you decide to offer your services as a freelancer on a dedicated platform. Soon, Pathé Gaumont cinemas call on you to build a community of moviegoers. They ask you to develop a movie rating platform, in collaboration with another freelancer. 

 

The idea is to allow registered users to rate movies (between 0 and 5) and thus create their own community score.

The site will be accessible without a user account, but unregistered visitors won’t be able to leave a rating; only logged in users will be able to do so.

 

To build this platform, Pathé Gaumont cinemas ask you to use an API that provides information about popular movies: YTS. 

 

You will retrieve the list of movies and their information (synopsis, year, actors …) through the YTS API. This means that you won’t actually store any information about the movies in your own database. You will retrieve a movie's information through the API every time, thanks to their YTS identifier. 

The only data your database will manage is the user ratings and user accounts.

 

For this you will discover a new JavaScript library, jQuery, and make your first AJAX requests.
